# Estimation

## Background

## Model setup

One of the main challenges to 

```@docs
EstimationSetup
```

Here describe the different structures/elements that need to be set up before the numerical routines can be run. Highlight that these structures are flexible and general enough to accomodate estimation of any model.

## Numerical routines

### Global stage

### Local stage

### Comparison with other algorithms

## Multithreading and multiprocessing

### Locally

### Cluster

## Two-step estimation
