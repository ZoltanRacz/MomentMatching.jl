# Estimation

## Background
Here describe very briefly the GMM/SMM problem and how it can be solved numerically.

## Model setup
Here describe the different structures/elements that need to be set up before the numerical routines can be run. Highlight that these structures are flexible and general enough to accomodate estimation of any model.

## Numerical routines

### Global stage

### Local stage

### Comparison with other algorithms

## Multithreading and multiprocessing

### Locally

### Cluster

## Two-step estimation
